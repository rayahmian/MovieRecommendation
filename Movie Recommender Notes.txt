1. Set up your environment:
- Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install Django: Open your terminal/command prompt and run pip install Django to install Django.

2. Create a new Django project:
- Open PyCharm and create a new Django project by going to File -> New Project -> Django.
- Follow the prompts to set up your project with the desired name and location.

3. Create a new Django app:
- Inside your Django project, create a new app by going to File -> New -> Django App.
- Name the app appropriately, such as "recommendations".

4. Prepare the CSV dataset:
- Make sure your CSV dataset is clean and well-structured, containing movie information like title, genre, description, etc.
- Place the CSV file in a location accessible by your Django app.

5. Create a model to represent movies:
- In the models.py file of your app, define a Django model that represents a movie. Each field in the model should correspond to a column in your CSV dataset.

6. Set up the database:
- Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migration files based on your models.
- Run python manage.py migrate to apply the migrations and create the necessary database tables.

7. Load data from the CSV to the database:
- Write a script or custom management command to read data from the CSV file and populate the database with movie records.
- You can use Python's built-in csv module to read the CSV file and Django's ORM to save records to the database.

8. Create views and templates:
- Define views that will handle requests to display movie recommendations on the app.
- Create HTML templates to render the movie recommendations in a user-friendly way.

9. Implement recommendation logic:
- Decide on the approach you want to use for movie recommendations (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid approaches).
- Implement the recommendation logic in your Django app.

10. Connect views to the recommendation logic:
- Update your views to use the recommendation logic to fetch relevant movie recommendations based on user preferences.

11. Build the frontend:
- Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (you can use Django's template language) to create a user interface for your app.
- Design the layout and user interactions to display movie recommendations.

12. Test your app:
- Use Django's built-in testing framework to write tests for your views and models.
- Test the app with various scenarios to ensure it functions correctly.

13. Deploy the app (optional):
- If you want to make the app accessible online, consider deploying it on a web hosting platform like Heroku or AWS.
